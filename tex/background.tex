\chapter{Background}\label{sec:background}
This chapter introduces some technical terms, technologies, and systems that
will occur throughout the rest of this report.

\section{Lambda Calculus}\label{sec:lambda-calc}
The lambda calculus is model of computation where the only behaviour is
function definition and application. It is commonly used to specify programming
language features and to formalize their behaviour. Specifically, it is
commonly used to reason about type systems. The lambda calculus can be viewed
as a miniature programming language and a system where strict properties can
be proved.

\subsection{Extensions}

The type system introduced in this paper introduces extensions to the simply
typed lambda calculus. The higher order polymorphic lambda calculus, known as
System F $\omega$, is included as well as a lifetime--calculus. Both are
described in Chapter~\ref{sec:formal}
