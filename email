Hi, just as an aside from the report- the other week I asked about the meaning
of "omega" in System F omega. I *think* I might have a rough idea why, maybe.

In the simply typed lambda calculus there's no abstraction over types obviously.
The only kind of abstraction you can have is over values. So it makes sense
that System F is sometimes called the second order lambda calculus, because
you can have abstraction over types as well, through type lambdas. So the
simply typed lambda calculus is level 1, and System F is level 2.

The next bit i'm a bit hazy about[cc
